# CST_utils

This is a library of small tools that help process CompoST (Composite Standard) files. This standard is presented at https://github.com/National-Composites-Centre/CompoST .

Tools here are not to be actively maintained and might be quite niche, so it was decide this does not belong to the CompoST repository. 

Some tools might be migrated to a dediated repository later.

The tools in this repo are documented here: https://national-composites-centre.github.io/CST_utils/ , but not all documentation will always be up to data due to developmental nature of this repo.
