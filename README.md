# CST_utils

This is a library of small tools that help process CompoST (Composite Standard) files. This standard is presented at https://github.com/National-Composites-Centre/CompoST .

Tools here are not to be actively maintained and might be quite niche, so it was decide this does not belong to the CompoST repository. 

Some tools might be migrated to a dediated repository later.
