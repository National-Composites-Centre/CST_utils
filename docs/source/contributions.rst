Contributions
=============

The CST_Utils is intended as amalgamation of many pieces of code that are held together only by working with CompoST. Therefore, the most common contribution forseen is a standalone integration script: in this scenario it is suggested that
the author simply makes a subfolder after cloning and branching the repository. This way it will be relatively simple to integrate the code in main, leaving the responsibility for the small sample code with the individual contributors.

Once any part of the code already existent here requires contribution, it is suggested that this code is moved to a dedicated repository for standard collaboration.
